4033,Infini,Infini Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn February 24, 2025, stablecoin payment platform Infini suffered a $50 million exploit, allegedly carried out by a developer who retained administrative privileges after contract deployment. Details of the ExploitThe attacker, suspected to be a former Infini smart contract developer, retained hidden admin privileges within the deployed contract. This allowed them to bypass security measures and withdraw $49.52 million in USDC without resistance. The exploit was carefully planned, as the attacker’s wallet was funded via Tornado Cash, ensuring anonymity. The stolen USDC was immediately swapped for DAI to prevent freezing, then exchanged for 17,696 ETH before being transferred to a fresh wallet (0xfcc8…6e49). The Infini team did not halt withdrawals, with CEO Christian Li stating they would fully compensate losses if needed. The attack occurred just days after Bybit’s record-breaking $1.4 billion hack, raising further concerns about security in the crypto space. On-chain analyst ZachXBT has yet to attribute the attack to a specific group, but suspicions remain on insider involvement, making this another example of the risks associated with centralized control over smart contracts.Block Data ReferenceExploiter https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ac96134fb0e42a52d33045aee50b89790f05ed0",2025-02-24,50000000,0,1,Stablecoin,Access Control,Unknown,Not Available
4032,Bybit,Bybit Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn February 21, 2025, Bybit, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, suffered a massive security breach, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.46 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH). The attack exploited a multisignature (multisig) cold wallet vulnerability through a sophisticated phishing and smart contract manipulation scheme. Details of the ExploitThe Bybit hack on February 21, 2025, resulted from a multisignature cold wallet breach caused by a sophisticated phishing attack that manipulated smart contract logic. The attackers deceived Bybit’s security team using a ""musked"" transaction, where the UI displayed a legitimate Safe (Gnosis Safe) address, but the actual transaction altered the wallet’s smart contract permissions, granting the hackers control. Once the fraudulent transaction was signed, the attackers withdrew 401,346 ETH (~$1.13 billion) and additional assets like mETH and stETH, swiftly swapping them for ETH on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to obscure their trail. On-chain analyst ZachXBT first flagged the suspicious transactions, prompting further investigation. The stolen assets were split across multiple wallets, making it difficult to track and recover the funds. Bybit confirmed that only one cold wallet was compromised and reassured users that withdrawals remained operational. Block Data ReferenceWithdraw TX:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb61413c495fdad6114a7aa863a00b2e3c28945979a10885b12b30316ea9f072c",2025-02-21,1400000000,43000000,1,CeFi,Access Control,Unknown,Not Available

4018,zkLend,zkLend Hack,"Quick SummaryOn February 12, 2025, zkLend, a lending protocol on Starknet, suffered an exploit due to a rounding error in the mint() function. The attacker manipulated the lending_accumulator to artificially inflate their balance, leading to a loss of $9.5M (3,600 ETH). Details of the ExploitThe attack exploited a rounding error in zkLend’s mint() function, where improper integer division (div(amount, accumulator)) caused downward rounding and balance inflation. By artificially increasing the lending_accumulator, the attacker repeatedly deposited and withdrew wstETH, gaining additional wei due to rounding inconsistencies. This cycle exponentially increased their holdings, allowing them to extract wstETH without proportional cost deductions. The stolen funds were then bridged to Ethereum and laundered through Railgun, though Railgun’s protocol policies returned the funds to the attacker’s original address.Block Data ReferenceAttacker’s Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x645c77833833A6654F7EdaA977eBEaBc680a9109",2025-02-12,9500000,0,1,Borrowing and Lending,Other,Unknown,Not Available

This vulnerability allowed an attacker to manipulate token prices and drain nearly $21,000 USD.Details of the ExploitThe core issue lay in the swapProfitFees function, which was designed to facilitate token swaps through PancakeSwap. However, the function lacked proper access control, allowing anyone to invoke it. The attacker exploited this flaw by first swapping a large amount of WBNB for LINK to manipulate the pool’s price. They then called the vulnerable function to swap LINK back to WBNB, profiting from the skewed pricing.

4011,AST Token,AST Token Hack,"Quick Summary On January 21, 2025, the AST token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was exploited, resulting in a loss of approximately $64,700 in USDT.Details of the ExploitThe exploit targeted a vulnerability in the AST token’s _transfer function during liquidity removal scenarios on PancakeSwap. When liquidity was removed, the logic incorrectly reduced the pair’s AST balance twice, creating an abnormally low reserve. This imbalance allowed the attacker to manipulate the automated market maker's pricing formula, enabling them to swap a small amount of AST for a disproportionately large amount of USDT. The attacker repeatedly triggered this scenario by transferring small LP tokens to initiate liquidity removal, ultimately draining approximately $64.7K USDT, which was then funneled through Tornado Cash.Block Data ReferenceAttack TX:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x80dd9362d211722b578af72d551f0a68e0dc1b1e077805353970b2f65e793927",2025-01-21,64700,0,2,Token,Other,Unknown,0xc10e0319337c7f83342424df72e73a70a29579b2#code

When the attacker sent a small amount of ETH to the contract, they could set the burnAmount variable. After exchanging a large amount of DOGE for BIGO, they invoked the transfer function, triggering _autoBurn and drastically reducing the BIGO balance in the PancakeSwap pair. With the pool now misaligned, the attacker swapped back to DOGE at a premium, draining almost all DOGE from the liquidity pool.Block Data ReferenceAttack Transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x8c9db55160a1484dd543e8a76e8a38eb58fccc63cdd5138cc46faf87e15bb9c9",2025-01-14,18000,0,2,Token,Other,Unknown,Not Available
4008,LAURA,LAURA token exploit,"Quick SummaryOn Jan 8, 2025, the LAURA token contract was exploited for around $48,000 due to a flawed removeLiquidityWhenKIncreases function. Details of the ExploitThe hacker first swapped significant WETH for LAURA and contributed LAURA and WETH liquidity to the Uniswap pool, raising the constant product (x * y = k). They then invoked the contract’s removeLiquidityWhenKIncreases() function, which failed to correctly handle the heightened K and thus allowed the attacker to remove more tokens than they deposited. Finally, the attacker traded back into WETH once the pool was misaligned, walking away with a net profit of approximately $48,000.Block Data ReferenceExploit tx:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xef34f4fdf03e403e3c94e96539354fb4fe0b79a5ec927eacc63bc04108dbf420",2025-01-08,48000,0,1,Token,Other,Unknown,Not Available

When the sender’s NFT balance was just one, their reward snapshot was deleted, resetting the record of claimed rewards. As a result, the attacker’s next reward calculation considered an unclaimed snapshot (treated as zero), repeatedly granting the full stETH share all over again.

4004,LABUBU,LABUBU token hacked,"Quick SummaryOn Dec-10-2024, the LABUBU token smart contract was exploited, resulting in a loss of approximately $120,000. Details of the ExploitThe core vulnerability lay in the token’s transfer logic, which allowed senders to increase their own balances simply by transferring tokens to themselves. The LABUBU contract did not properly handle transfers where the sender and recipient addresses were the same. As a result, a malicious user could repeatedly “send” tokens to their own address, artificially inflating their token balance without cost. By exploiting this flawed mechanism, the attacker drained around $120,000 worth of tokens from the system before the vulnerability was discovered and addressed.Block Data ReferenceExploit tx:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb06df371029456f2bf2d2edb732d1f3c8292d4271d362390961fdcc63a2382de ",2024-12-10,120000,0,2,Token,Other,Unknown,0x2ff960f1d9af1a6368c2866f79080c1e0b253997
4003,Mosca,Mosca Hack,"Quick SummaryOn January 8, 2025, the Mosca smart contract on Binance Smart Chain was exploited due to flawed balance resets in the exitProgram function. The attacker took advantage of improperly cleared user balances, repeatedly withdrawing tokens and resulting in a total loss of about $19,500. Details of the ExploitThe vulnerability stemmed from the withdrawAll function, which calculates a user’s withdrawal amount by summing user.balance, user.balanceUSDT, and user.balanceUSDC. After the withdrawal, only user.balance was set to zero, leaving user.balanceUSDT and user.balanceUSDC intact. An attacker increased their balance in USDC, joined the contract’s reward queue, and then repeatedly invoked exitProgram to withdraw tokens multiple times. Each call exploited the non-zero USDT/USDC balances that were never reset, ultimately allowing the attacker to accumulate roughly $19,500 in stolen funds.Block Data ReferenceAttack Transaction: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4e5bb7e3f552f5ee6ee97db9a9fcf07287aae9a1974e24999690855741121aff",2025-01-08,19500,0,2,Yield Aggregator,Other,Unknown,0x1962b3356122d6a56f978e112d14f5e23a25037d#code

The relayer then approved large sums of FEG tokens for withdrawal on BSC, which the attacker quickly redeemed for profit. The three primary transactions illustrate the progression of the hack: first, the attacker submitted a malicious Wormhole payload from Base; next, the relayer incorrectly authorized token withdrawals on BSC; finally, the attacker withdrew the tokens and monetized them.

4001,MoonHacker,MoonHacker Vault exploited,"Quick SummaryOn December 23, 2024, the MoonHacker vault contracts on Optimism were exploited for roughly $320,000 in USDC.Details of the ExploitThe attacker took out a flash loan in USDC from Aave and substituted a malicious contract for the mToken parameter in the MoonHacker vault’s executeOperation function. Because no validation prevented unauthorized addresses, the vault mistakenly granted approval to the attacker’s malicious contract. This facilitated a transfer of USDC from the vault, after which the attacker repeatedly called repayBorrow and redeem to siphon out remaining tokens. They then repaid the flash loan, securing the stolen USDC in the process. MoonHacker deployers, who are unknown to Moonwell, are now working with relevant parties to investigate and recover the stolen funds. Importantly, no Moonwell core lending pools were compromised.Block Data ReferenceExploit tx:https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xd12016b25d7aef681ade3dc3c9d1a1cc12f35b2c99953ff0e0ee23a59454c4feAttacker address:https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x36491840ebcf040413003df9fb65b6bc9a181f52",2024-12-23,320000,0,Not Available,Yield Aggregator,Flash Loan Attack,Unknown,Not Available

Observers noted that the newly created tokens were quickly sent to major exchanges, including Binance, and then sold, crashing the token’s market value. Community members criticized this approach, arguing that Binance’s grace period before delisting was misused to dump tokens. Some called for tighter oversight from exchanges—such as freezing project-wallet deposits or implementing an immediate halt on trading to protect users from similar “last-minute” liquidity exits. ",2024-11-28,10000000,0,2,Gaming / Metaverse,Rugpull,Unknown,Not Available

Initial reports estimated losses at $21 million, but the total has risen to nearly $30 million due to significant price fluctuations in the stolen meme tokens. Details of the ExploitThe attacker gained unauthorized access to private keys within DEXX’s system, enabling them to redirect user funds into addresses controlled on Solana and other networks. Many users lost less than $10,000, but at least one address reportedly lost over $1 million. In response, DEXX suspended certain services, published warnings, and offered a reward if the stolen funds were returned. Despite these measures, no stolen assets have been recovered.

3994,Clober,Clober DEX Reentrancy Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn December 10, 2024, CloberDEX’s Liquidity Vault on the Base network was exploited through a reentrancy vulnerability in the _burn() function, resulting in the theft of approximately 133.7 ETH (~$501,279).Details of the ExploitThe exploit stemmed from the _burn() function in the Rebalancer contract, where token transfers occurred before critical state variables (pool.reserveA and pool.reserveB) were updated. This deviation from the checks-effects-interactions pattern enabled a reentrancy scenario. The attacker could repeatedly call the function, exploiting the unmodified reserve values to miscalculate withdrawal amounts and drain significant funds. By timing interactions and re-entering the contract mid-execution, the attacker extracted 133.7 ETH without triggering immediate safeguards. In response, CloberDEX promptly contacted the attacker, requested the stolen funds be returned, and reassured users that the incident did not compromise Clober Core or threaten the integrity of the Mitosis testnet.Block Data ReferenceAttacker https://basescan.org/address/0x012fc6377f1c5ccf6e29967bce52e3629aaa6025Exploit txhttps://basescan.org/tx/0x8fcdfcded45100437ff94801090355f2f689941dca75de9a702e01670f361c04",2024-12-10,500000,0,49,Exchange (DEX),Reentrancy,Unknown,Not Available

By exploiting this logical flaw, they conducted transactions involving 500K or 520K VSTR tokens, each yielding 20K VSTR per call. The attacker then transferred the stolen tokens and prioritized their transactions by spending significant gas fees.This exploit caused the VSTR token's price to drop from $0.013 to $0.005 before a slight recovery to $0.009. Vestra DAO acknowledged the breach, blacklisted the compromised contract, and implemented preventative measures.

However, public functions permitted anyone to toggle this variable. The attacker set fixedPriceEnabled to true, enabling the mint function and disabling the balance check in swap(). They conducted swaps where 1 USDT was exchanged for millions of NAS tokens. After accumulating NAS, they toggled fixedPriceEnabled back to false, sold the tokens, and drained the USDT liquidity.The attacker ultimately transferred 493,652 USDT to a wallet linked to a prior CryptoBottle exploit on October 22.

3991,DCT Token,DCT Token Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn November 2024, an unknown DCT token on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) suffered an attack, resulting in losses exceeding $428K.Details of the ExploitThe exploit leveraged a design flaw in the DCT token’s transfer mechanism, which included a forced investment feature. When DCT tokens were sent to the USDT-DCT liquidity pool, 5% of the transferred tokens were automatically swapped for USDT and added to the liquidity pool. This triggered a price swap in the USDT-DCT pool, which the attacker manipulated to inflate the price of DCT tokens. By exploiting this mechanism, the attacker executed profitable swaps, draining the pool and realizing significant financial gains.Block Data ReferenceExploit tx:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb375932951c271606360b6bf4287d080c5601f4f59452b0484ea6c856defd6fd",2024-11-25,428000,0,2,Token,Flash Loan Attack,DCT,0x56f46bd073e9978eb6984c0c3e5c661407c3a447

This factory contract was meant to add liquidity to the Uniswap vETH-BIF pair using borrowed vETH and the user’s BIF tokens. However, the attacker manipulated the liquidity pool during this process by borrowing vETH without proper constraints.

3988,Polter Finance,Polter Finance Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn November 16, 2024, Polter Finance, a DeFi lending platform on the Fantom network, experienced a severe security breach that led to the loss of around $8.7 million. Details of the ExploitThe exploit began with the attacker targeting a vulnerability in the price validation logic of the AaveOracle contract, which Polter Finance depended on for price feeds. The key weakness was in the ChainlinkUniV2Adapter, which relied on spot prices without adequate validation. The attacker exploited this weakness by executing a flash loan of 269,042 BOO and 1,154,788 BOO tokens from Spooky V2 and Spooky V3 liquidity pools, significantly reducing the token reserves in those pools and causing an abnormal price spike for the BOO token.Using this inflated price, the attacker deposited a single BOO token as collateral in Polter's lending pool. Due to the flawed oracle system, the value of this 1 BOO token was calculated at an astronomical $1.37 trillion instead of its true market value. The platform's smart contract failed to detect this discrepancy because the price validation checks within the _fetchPrice and getRoundData functions were inadequate, allowing the manipulated price to go unchallenged.The attacker repeatedly leveraged the inflated price of the BOO token to borrow wFTM tokens, ultimately draining a total of 9,134,844 wFTM from the lending pools. The price data retrieved by the latestRoundData function failed to account for the rapid changes caused by the flash loan manipulation, lacking necessary safeguards for drastic price swings.As part of the exploitation, the attacker used flaws in the _getPriceAndTimestamp function, which contained hardcoded values and insufficient price fluctuation checks. These issues enabled the attacker to execute multiple borrowing operations without triggering any validation alarms, leading to the loss of $8.7 million.In an effort to retrieve the stolen funds, the Polter Finance team has reached out to the attacker via social media channels and filed a police report.",2024-11-16,8700000,0,4,Borrowing and Lending,Oracle Issue,Unknown,Not Available
3987,Metawin,Metawin Hacked,"Quick SummaryOn November 3, 2024, MetaWin, a prominent online crypto casino, suffered a security breach that resulted in the loss of approximately $4 million. Details of the ExploitThe breach at MetaWin exploited the platform’s instant withdrawal mechanism, which was designed for seamless and rapid transactions. This ""frictionless"" system inadvertently allowed a hacker to bypass traditional security checks, gaining access to the casino’s Ethereum and Solana hot wallets. Hot wallets, which remain online for quick transaction processing, are inherently more vulnerable, and this became the critical entry point for the attack.Upon detecting the intrusion, MetaWin swiftly disabled withdrawals to secure the system. However, the damage was already done, with over $4 million drained from the platform. The hacker’s method involved targeting addresses directly linked to the withdrawal system, using a sophisticated approach that leveraged over 115 addresses. Blockchain expert ZachXBT collaborated with MetaWin to trace the stolen assets, revealing that the hacker funneled the funds through KuCoin and HitBTC, platforms often utilized for obfuscating the origin of stolen funds.",2024-11-03,4000000,0,"1,24",Gaming / Metaverse,Access Control,Unknown,Not Available
3986,Delta Prime,Delta Prime Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn November 11th, 2024, DeltaPrime, a DeFi protocol operating on both Arbitrum and Avalanche networks, experienced a sophisticated exploit leading to a $4.75 million loss. Details of the ExploitThe DeltaPrime exploit was rooted in two key vulnerabilities: improper validation of borrowing in the swapDebtParaSwap function and unchecked external contract inputs in the claimReward function. In the first instance, the attacker used 59.9 ETH as collateral to borrow 1.18 WBTC. The _repayAmount variable was not validated, allowing the attacker to use a malicious contract to transfer borrowed WBTC without initiating a repayment check, sending it to another address.The second flaw involved the claimReward() function. This function accepted arbitrary external contract addresses for reward claims, which the attacker exploited by passing a malicious contract through the pair parameter. This contract manipulated the internal balances of DeltaPrime, deceiving the protocol into paying out additional rewards. Specifically, the attacker’s contract triggered the wrapNative() function, converting ETH collateral into WETH, which then appeared as a rewardable balance. This trick allowed the attacker to extract 59.9 ETH as rewards.Instead of cashing out, the attacker chose a novel strategy, reinvesting the stolen assets across DeFi platforms on Avalanche. This included $600K staked in USDC via Stargate, $518K in liquidity for USDC/USDT pairs, 4,865 AVAX staked, 49.68 WETH.e, and 6.34 BTC.b. DeltaPrime acknowledged the incident via social media and their Discord server, highlighting the heaviest losses in AVAX and ETH pools on Avalanche and in ARB and ETH pools on Arbitrum.

A critical vulnerability was found in the contract's _burn function, which directly adjusted the balance within _balances[account] rather than utilizing the getFreeBalance method. This discrepancy allowed the attacker to manipulate token balances, bypassing restrictions tied to staked tokens.By initiating a flash loan for 1,000,000 tokens, the attacker was able to buy ICO tokens from Vista Finance using $1,500 in BUSD. These ICO tokens were then sold to another address for a profit. The exploit relied on the fact that getFreeBalance did not properly account for staked status, allowing the attacker to use the flash-minted tokens to bypass the staking limitations and cash out the gains undetected.",2024-10-22,29000,0,2,Token,Flash Loan Attack,Unknown,Not Available

Reports of sudden, multimillion-dollar collateral withdrawals intensified suspicions. Details of the ExploitEssence Finance’s stablecoin CHI faced a severe crash in the Scroll ecosystem, dropping 98% in value, amid suspicions of a rug pull. This turmoil stemmed from sudden multimillion-dollar withdrawals, prompting fears and distrust among investors. Adding to the controversy, the project’s communication channels have been largely silent since September, intensifying speculation. Meanwhile, CHI’s trading volume remains active, showing lingering interest despite the sharp price decline.Essence Finance’s stablecoin project has faced scrutiny for its centralized design, where a multisig wallet, controlled by select project members, could manage and operate collateral assets. During the incident, the multisig wallet was used to drain the CHI minter contract and shift substantial collateral into USDC/CHIUSD and DAI/CHIUSD pairs. This centralized control over collateral allowed the operators to restrict redemptions, blocking users from accessing their CHI holdings. With CHI’s stability already fragile due to a small depeg, this inability to redeem triggered a liquidity crisis resembling a bank run, leading to the drastic price collapse.",2024-10-26,20000000,0,Not Available,Stablecoin,Other,Unknown,Not Available
3982,Ramses,Ramses DEX Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn October 24, 2024, Ramses Exchange on the Arbitrum network lost around $93,000 due to a flaw in its reward distribution system. The attacker repeatedly claimed rewards by leveraging multiple token IDs without reducing the overall reward pool supply. This exploit targeted Ramses’ reward accumulation process rather than affecting liquidity provider assets or user holdings. Ramses Exchange confirmed that liquidity provider funds and user NFTs remain secure despite the incident.Details of the ExploitThe exploit stemmed from a vulnerability in the Ramses FeeDistributor contract, where the system failed to reduce the total reward supply after each reward claim. By repeatedly using the _getReward() function with multiple NFT token IDs, the attacker manipulated the reward calculations to gain excess rewards. The attacker’s strategy included resetting or splitting NFTs into new token IDs, effectively bypassing the tracking mechanism veWithdrawnTokenAmountByPeriod that restricts double-claiming within the same period. Additionally, the attacker used the getPeriodReward() function with arbitrary period values to retroactively access unclaimed rewards, exploiting a lack of timestamp validation in the contract.Block Data ReferenceExploit tx:https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xb91c4e0debaf0feb1f20c979eebc1282c8024ae299ef5903591badcf1f4938bbAttacker:https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1d8b0ee375750839567f266fa75f6fbc9d6b977c",2024-10-24,93000,0,5,Exchange (DEX),Other,Unknown,0xaaa6c1e32c55a7bfa8066a6fae9b42650f262418

Attackers gained access to three out of 11 private keys needed to control Radiant's smart contracts, allowing them to drain funds across multiple blockchains. The breach impacted liquidity pools on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Arbitrum networks, forcing Radiant to suspend its markets on Ethereum and Base as part of its damage control efforts.The attackers compromised Radiant’s multi-signature wallet, which requires multiple key holders to approve critical actions. By obtaining three private keys, they gained sufficient control to upgrade the protocol’s smart contracts and initiate unauthorized transfers of assets. Hackers drained liquidity pools holding popular tokens like USDC, WBTC, WETH, and BNB. Notably, $18 million was stolen from Radiant's BSC pools, and additional funds were compromised on Arbitrum.

By deploying a malicious contract, they manipulated the market’s exchange rates within the protocol, artificially inflating the value of small deposits. This allowed them to withdraw 4.1 million VUSD along with other cryptocurrencies, such as XCN, DAI, WBTC, and USDT. The attackers executed multiple transactions to miscalculate and inflate their token values, minting excessive amounts of VUSD, which they then converted to other cryptocurrencies.

3976,Fire Token,Fire Token Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn October 1, 2024, the FireToken smart contract was exploited within 24 seconds of its launch, leading to an attacker profiting around $24,000. The vulnerability lay in its token-burning mechanism, which allowed manipulation of the Uniswap liquidity pool's balance.Details of the ExploitThe root cause of the exploit stemmed from the FireToken contract's implementation of a token-burning mechanism during transfers. The contract's _transfer() function removed a portion of FireTokens from the circulating supply and sent them to a burn address, reducing the liquidity pool's token reserves. Each time a transfer occurred, the function immediately called sync() to update the Uniswap pool's reserves. This setup allowed the attacker to reduce FireToken reserves while keeping the ETH reserves constant. By decreasing FireToken reserves, the attacker created a price discrepancy in line with Uniswap’s constant product formula (x * y = k), making ETH appear more valuable relative to the dwindling FireTokens.Block Data ReferenceExploit tx:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd20b3b31a682322eb0698ecd67a6d8a040ccea653ba429ec73e3584fa176ff2b",2024-10-01,24000,0,1,Token,Other,FIRE,0x18775475f50557b96c63e8bbf7d75bfeb412082d
3975,Bankroll,Bankroll Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn September 22, 2024, the DeFi protocol Bankroll Network was exploited, leading to a $230,000 loss due to a vulnerability in its token sale contract.Details of the ExploitThe attack focused on the ""buyFor"" function of the Bankroll Network’s token sale contract, which is designed to allow users to buy tokens for others by sending WBNB to a pool. However, the exploit allowed the hacker to manipulate the “profitPerShare_” variable by making the victim contract its own customer. This allowed the attacker to artificially inflate their share of the pool's profits without depositing the required WBNB. After buying some tokens, the hacker repeatedly invoked the ""buyFor"" function hundreds of times, drastically increasing the ""profitPerShare_."" They then used the ""withdraw"" function to collect an oversized profit in WBNB, extracting $230,000 from the system. The attack likely used flash loans to make the initial deposit and trigger the manipulation.Block Data ReferenceExploit tx:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xd4c7c11c46f81b6bf98284e4921a5b9f0ff97b4c71ebade206cb10507e4503b0",2024-09-22,230000,0,2,Yield Aggregator,Flash Loan Attack,Unknown,Not Available

The attacker quickly swapped these assets to Ethereum, but another wave of malicious transactions increased the total stolen to nearly $6 million. Onchain security firm Cyvers suggested that the exploit was caused by the loss of control over Delta Prime's admin wallet. The hacker gained access to the wallet’s private key, allowing them to modify Delta Prime’s proxy contracts. This upgrade pointed the contracts to a malicious one, enabling the attacker to drain liquidity pools on the Arbitrum chain.Block Data ReferenceExploiter address:https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd550cfea0bffdc81b2dee7b6d915d9d9e31d83a2",2024-09-16,6000000,0,5,Yield Aggregator,Access Control,Unknown,Not Available

The hacker exploited at least ten different addresses to collect a range of cryptocurrencies, which were then quickly swapped to Ethereum. While initial estimates of the loss were around $26 million, further investigation revealed the damage to be much greater, with the total loss rising to $52 million. Although the exact method of the attack remains unclear, many security experts, including PeckShield and Cyvers Alerts, have linked the hack to the notorious Lazarus Group, known for its expertise in social engineering and cryptocurrency exploits.",2024-09-20,52000000,0,Not Available,CeFi,Other,Unknown,Not Available

The hacker systematically breached Indodax's withdrawal system, allowing unauthorized transfers of funds across multiple blockchain networks. Assets were stolen from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, Polygon, and Optimism, among others. Security experts from firms like SlowMist and Cyvers suggest that the hacker exploited vulnerabilities in how Indodax processes withdrawals, potentially by manipulating signature verification mechanisms. After obtaining the funds, the hacker swiftly converted various tokens into Ethereum and began using Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing service, to obscure the trail of the stolen assets. Despite the breach, Indodax's team acted quickly to suspend operations and limit further damage, though significant losses were already incurred.Block Data ReferenceThe stolen funds were directed to the following wallets:Bitcoin: bc1q5uqpn0ha5llrvhcvkq3nfalp8fj7qe3rydcvmfTron: TBooefeY6FvGuyKfvp5yE1HmzhzvXnvA1PEthereum/ERC-20: 0xb0a2e43d3e0dc4c71346a71484ac6a2627bbcbedOptimism: 0x3b8f1131a20e131c195bda6fdd6e9be38935eb6dPolygon: 0x90fffbc09e9a5f6d035e92d25d67e244ef5e904fEthereum (ETH): 0x59101e532bc728599a2d373fcdc7aff58cb48df8",2024-09-10,22000000,0,Not Available,CeFi,Other,Unknown,Not Available

This phishing transaction resulted in the victim losing control of their proxy contract. Six hours later, when the victim attempted to execute a transaction, it failed because they were no longer the owner of the proxy. Subsequently, the attacker changed the ownership of the proxy to 0x5D4b2A02c59197eB2cAe95A6Df9fE27af60459d4, allowing them to drain all the DAI from the compromised contract.Block Data ReferenceExploit tx:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf70042bf3ae7c22f0680f8afa078c38989ed475dfbe5c8d8f30a50d4d2f45dc4",2024-08-21,55000000,0,1,Other,Phishing,Unknown,Not Available

The function, which interacted with the Paraswap contract, left a high token allowance unadjusted if a swap failed or was only partially executed. This unadjusted allowance allowed the attacker to withdraw unauthorized tokens. The vulnerability arose because the function did not properly validate or sanitize paraswapData and failed to verify the swap outcome. The attacker crafted malicious paraswapData, manipulating the swap process or avoiding it entirely. By exploiting the unchecked token allowance, the attacker bypassed the intended swap logic, enabling unauthorized fund transfers from the contract.Block Data ReferenceExploiter:https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ea83f23795F55434C38bA67FCc428aec0C296DCExploit tx:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc27c3ec61c61309c9af35af062a834e0d6914f9352113617400577c0f2b0e9de",2024-08-28,56000,0,1,Borrowing and Lending,Other,Unknown,0x02e7b8511831b1b02d9018215a0f8f500ea5c6b3

3958,Minterest,Minterest Exploit,"Quick SummaryOn July 15, 2024, Minterest experienced a malicious entry resulting in the theft of approximately $1,460,000 worth of mETH and ETH. Details of the ExploitIn July 2024, Minterest fell victim to a hack where an attacker stole approximately $1.4 million in cryptocurrency from the protocol by exploiting a reentrancy vulnerability through a flashloan attack on the Mantle Network. The attacker initiated the attack by taking a flashloan and borrowing USDY tokens from Minterest's flashLoan function, which triggered their fallback function, allowing them to manipulate the market’s exchange rates. This manipulation resulted in a lower cash balance for the market. When Minterest's contract called the attacker's fallback function, the attacker converted USDY tokens to mUSD and reentered the Minterest contract via the lendRUSDY function, exploiting the modified exchange rate to receive excess mTokens. The attacker then withdrew the underlying tokens, causing Minterest to burn some mTokens but retain the excess. Repeating this process multiple times, the attacker accumulated an estimated $1.7 million in mTokens in the mUSDY market, which they used to borrow WETH and mETH, ultimately draining $1.4 million from the protocol. This exploit also led to the liquidation of many user positions within the mUSDY market.Block Data ReferenceAttackerhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x618f768af6291705eb13e0b2e96600b3851911d1Funding by Tornado:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x99fa85d1549205f63aedc14a6878fc0357b26c7c6c0b69813ce86ff4b315eaeeExample of the Tornado deposit:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe14c67b2f107e352aca8a796dc2e07b9d32777cd37d913ba9762eed3364d2710",2024-07-15,1460000,0,1,Borrowing and Lending,Other,Unknown,Not Available

Web3 security firm Cyvers flagged suspicious transactions and confirmed that Aave's pools were safe, though Dough Finance was heavily impacted. The attacker used the ZK protocol Railgun to fund the attack and swapped stolen USD Coin for 608 ETH, worth about $1.8 million. Web3 security provider Olympix identified the cause of the exploit as unvalidated call data within the “ConnectorDeleverageParaswap” contract, allowing the attacker to manipulate data during flash loan calls.

3956,WazirX,WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange Exploit,"Quick SummaryWazirXIndia Exchange Multisig got compromised and lost $230M worth of assets on $ETHDetails of the ExploitOn July 19, 2024, the WazirX Multisig was exploited, resulting in the theft of $230M. The attacker managed to drain the funds by first compromising the signers' Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and subsequently changing the implementation of the Multisig. The attack began with a specific transaction (Etherscan link), where the attacker executed a delegate call from the compromised multisig to a proprietary contract deployed eight days earlier. The delegate call data was 0x804e1f0a000000000000000000000000ef279c2ab14960aa319008cbea384b9f8ac35fc6, which modified the slot 0 of the multisig proxy to point to the new proprietary contract. Tools like evm.storage confirmed that before the attack, slot 0 contained the standard safe implementation, and afterward, it pointed to the attacker's contract. Further analysis showed that after the implementation modification, all transactions to the Safe Multisig redirected delegate calls to the new address, which simply transferred assets to the attacker.Block Data ReferenceAttackerhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xd967113224c354600b3151e27aaba53e3034f372Attack tx:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x48164d3adbab78c2cb9876f6e17f88e321097fcd14cadd57556866e4ef3e185d",2024-07-18,230000000,0,1,CeFi,Access Control,Unknown,Not Available
3955,LI.FI,LI.FI Exploit,"Quick SummaryJul 16, 2024, DeFi Protocol LI.FI Hit by $8M ExploitDetails of the ExploitOn July 16th, 2024, Li.Fi, a cross-chain DeFi protocol, suffered a significant exploit due to an arbitrary call vulnerability, resulting in a loss of approximately $8 million. The vulnerability resided in the depositToGasZipERC20 function within the GasZipFacet.sol contract. This function allowed the _swapData parameter to be passed directly to LibSwap.swap, which included a low-level call that could execute arbitrary functions. Since the attacker had control over _swap.callTo and _swap.callData, they were able to craft malicious calldata with transferFrom() calls. With sufficient token spending approval, the attacker executed unauthorized transferFrom() calls to siphon funds from the protocol. Li.Fi has advised users to revoke approvals for specific addresses and has disabled the affected smart contract facet to contain the exploit. This incident is particularly notable as it echoes a similar $600,000 loss in 2022 due to the same bug in the protocol’s swapping feature.Block Data ReferenceAttackerhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x7742ed59e9ecf1712bc4c6bdd0c526e903a7f2c8Vulnerable contacthttps://etherscan.io/address/0xf28a352377663ca134bd27b582b1a9a4dad7e534#codeAttack tx:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd82fe84e63b1aa52e1ce540582ee0895ba4a71ec5e7a632a3faa1aff3e763873https://etherscan.io/tx/0x65a92b189e4ae0b8a8a02cd59c5e9f6832586bd5167d41a24eb4f4d2ac692755",2024-07-16,8000000,0,"1,47,51",Exchange (DEX),Other,Unknown,"0x1231deb6f5749ef6ce6943a275a1d3e7486f4eae,0x341e94069f53234fE6DabeF707aD424830525715"

The breach was due to vulnerabilities within the Balancer-style CPMM pool contract, particularly faulty logic in the velocore__execute() function and issues with the fee rate calculation logic that allowed effectiveFee1e9 to exceed 100%. Additionally, there was a potential underflow issue during single-token withdrawals and a lack of caller verification in the velocore__execute() function. The attacker used funds from Tornado Cash, executed the exploit, bridged the funds through Across Bridge, and redeposited them back into Tornado Cash. While all volatile pools in Linea and zkSyncEra Velocore were affected, stable pools and the Telos Velocore pools were not impacted as the issue was mitigated beforehand.

3922,Remilia,Remilia Treasury Exploited,"Quick SummaryCrypto Breach: Millions in Ether and NFTs Compromised, Milady Founder Responds.Details of the ExploitCharlotte Fang, founder of Milady and Remilia, confirmed a security breach resulting in millions of dollars' worth of Ether and NFTs being moved to a wallet involved in asset liquidation. Dumpster DAO first noticed the unusual transaction, prompting Fang's acknowledgment of a breach involving the Remilia treasury. The breach, attributed to unknown malware infiltrating Fang's password manager, affected connected wallets, including the multisig wallet for Remilia's funds. Assets were sold for around 850 ETH, nearly $3 million. Despite this, Fang assured that NFT ownership and the operating treasury were secure. The organization has no immediate plans to sell NFTs, minimizing impact on budgeted operations. The crypto community, skeptical of Fang's claims, prompted investigation by Web 3 security experts like Peckshield. This incident follows controversy in September, where Fang disclosed a misappropriation of $1 million from the treasury and faced accusations of misusing $1.7 million, leading to a lawsuit and removal due to alleged dissemination of extremist content. Milady, featuring anime-style women NFTs, has garnered attention despite these challenges.Block Data ReferenceExploiter:https://etherscan.io/address/0x778Be423ef77A20A4493f846BdbcDDfc30252cE9Treasury:https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf3e932f72e5f15411d125ad80579a3ef205b9b4",2024-03-17,3000000,0,1,Other,Access Control,Unknown,"0x24ea6c329072b90c78341189b72288e2315a4458,0xcf3e932f72e5f15411d125ad80579a3ef205b9b4#code"

3820,BearnDAO,BearnDAO Exploit,"Quick SummaryBearn DAO exploited through price manipulation attack on BSC, leading to a loss of approximately $769,000 in assets.Details of the ExploitBearn DAO, a decentralized reserve currency protocol on the Binance Smart Chain, was exploited on December 6, 2023. A vulnerability in the smart contract allowed the attacker to manipulate token swap ratios and execute a profitable sandwich attack. The attacker exploited the BvaultsStrategy contract's convertDustToEarned function, which relied on the current balance of the `wantToken` token. By manipulating the ALPACA/WBNB pool and invoking the convertDustToEarned function, they artificially inflated the swap ratio, resulting in a loss of approximately $768,358 worth of assets. The exploiter then swapped the stolen BUSD to WBNB via 1inch, sent it to another EOA, and deposited it into TornadoCash. The Bearn team sent an on-chain message to the attacker, requesting a refund of a portion of the stolen funds to reimburse affected users.Block Data ReferenceAttacker Address:https://bscscan.com/address/0xCE27b195Fa6dE27081a86b98b64f77F5FB328dd5Malicious Transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x51913be3f31d5ddbfc77da789e5f9653ed6b219a52772309802226445a1edd5fMalicious Contract Address:https://bscscan.com/address/0xe1997bC971D5986AA57Ee8ffB57eb1DeBa4fDAaaOnchain Message from BearnDAO Team:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xc0300811fc489424dfdceca537d0d015b0f75b6a9485e56b02d6a818e5cdc942TornadoCash Deposit Transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x25892a61d0e1d37688d05cf5687dd1e44195f7c690a2ed0aefa9231ed5070904",2023-12-06,768363,0,2,Other,Other,Unknown,0x21125d94cfe886e7179c8d2fe8c1ea8d57c73e0e

3652,CoinsPaid,CoinsPaid $37 Million Heist Orchestrated by Lazarus Group,"Quick SummaryCrypto payments provider CoinsPaid suffered a $37 million heist orchestrated by North Korea's Lazarus Group. The attack involved six months of social engineering, culminating in an employee being manipulated via a deceptive job offer.Details of the Exploit The $37 million heist on CoinsPaid was executed by North Korea's Lazarus Group through a sophisticated campaign spanning six months. The attack focused on social engineering tactics, with hackers relentlessly targeting CoinsPaid's team members. The campaign involved spam, phishing, fake job offers, and bribery attempts.The climax of the attack occurred on July 22 when an employee, believing they were being interviewed for a job with Crypto.com, unwittingly downloaded malicious software as part of a technical test. The hackers leveraged their extensive research on CoinsPaid, including its team structure, to create a convincing story that exploited the employee's trust.Upon infiltrating the system, the hackers exploited a software vulnerability to gain authorized access to CoinsPaid's hot wallets. While they couldn't directly access private keys, they successfully withdrew most of the funds to decentralized exchanges like SwftSwap, SunSwap, and SimpleSwap. Funds were also routed through mixers to obscure their movement.CoinsPaid emphasized the necessity of employee training to recognize social engineering tactics and the significance of recognizing seemingly insignificant hack attempts as potential precursors to larger operations. Despite impacting the company's revenue, no customer funds were lost.",2023-07-22,37000000,0,Not Available,Other,Other,Unknown,Not Available

Upon buying, the attacker was able to execute removeLiquidity(), which returned most of the funds in BUSDT back. However, a significant balance of USDP remained.

They've distributed phishing links through hacked Discord accounts, leading to numerous users inadvertently opening malicious websites and signing fraudulent digital signatures. This has resulted in a significant loss of user assets, amounting to around 3,548,566 $USD. Through the analysis of stolen data on various chains, it was discovered that the group has affected almost 1,932 victims.

The judgment permanently bans Ackerman from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets and mandates him to pay 27,000,000 $USD in restitution to his victims and a further 27,000,000 $USD as a civil monetary penalty. The judgment marks the resolution of the CFTC's enforcement case against Ackerman, which alleged that between August 2017 and December 2019, Ackerman operated a fraudulent scheme that lured and misappropriated funds under the guise of trading digital commodity assets. It was suggested that Ackerman's fraudulent misrepresentations led more than 150 individuals and entities to deposit at least 33,000,000 $USD with him. However, less than 10,000,000 $USD of this amount were used for actual trading, while the rest was appropriated for personal use and to sustain the fraudulent scheme. To attract potential investors, Ackerman falsely claimed to be generating profitable trades and monthly returns of around 15%. The reality was, Ackerman was an unsuccessful trader and used false accounting statements, misleading newsletters, and fabricated screenshots to hide the truth. In a related criminal case, Ackerman was sentenced in February 2022 to five years of probation with a year of home confinement, and he was later ordered in August 2022 to pay an additional 31,000,000 $USD in restitution.",2023-06-28,33000000,0,Not Available,Other,Other,Unknown,Not Available

The attacker used 80,000,000 $USD to manipulate the token price and made a profit of 714,285 $USD.Details of the ExploitCS is a BEP20 token trading on PancakeSwap. The token's CS/USD pool was drained via a flash loan attack. The attack started from the malicious contract deployment by the exploiter, which took 80,000,000 $USD as a flash loan from the BSC-USD pool. Consequently, multiple swaps with a small amount of 5,000 $USD was continuously repeated to manipulate the pool's price. After reaching some conditions, the attacker could swap the $CS tokens back with an unfairly high price and the total amount gained back went to 80,954,285 $USD. 240,000 $USD were paid back to the BSC-USD pool as a flash loan fee after the base amount was returned. The exploiter's profit reached 714,285 $USD, which was transferred to the initial EOA, and then distributed between several addresses.

The project's Governance was exploited via malicious proposal. On May 20th, 2023 Tornado Cash governance ceased to exist as an attacker granted themselves over 1.2 million fake votes through a malicious proposal. With full control of governance, they could withdraw all locked votes and drain tokens from the contract or brick the router. The attack was sophisticatedly designed by using various tricks like combining CREATE/CREATE2 to create a contract with different bytecode and hiding intent behind emergencyStop() named function while updating proposal logic to grant themselves fake votes. Once gaining control, the attacker drained various contracts and users staking assets as $TRON tokens. The stolen tokens were swapped for $ETH and 360 $ETH was transferred through TornadoCash, while 120.4 $ETH remains at the attacker's address along with 177,340 $USD worth $TORN tokens. Consequently, over 500,000 $TORN tokens were used by the attacker to propose the 21st proposal, which seemingly may return the protocol control back to the users. The total stolen amount reached 1,049,513 $USD, and maybe even more cause of locked $TORN tokens in the next proposal from the attacker. Block Data ReferenceAttacker's Funds Holder Address:https://etherscan.io/address/0x092123663804f8801b9b086b03B98D706f77bD59Malicious Proposal Executor Address:https://etherscan.io/address/0x592340957eBC9e4Afb0E9Af221d06fDDDF789de9Proposal Execution Transaction:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3274b6090685b842aca80b304a4dcee0f61ef8b6afee10b7c7533c32fb75486dSelfdestruct Transaction:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd3a570af795405e141988c48527a595434665089117473bc0389e83091391adbVote Gain Transaction:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa7d20ccdbc2365578a106093e82cc9f6ec5d03043bb6a00114c0ad5d03620122Malicious Proposal:https://etherscan.io/address/0xC503893b3e3c0C6b909222b45f2a3a259a52752D21st Proposal:https://etherscan.io/address/0x1FAd009aD35689B5a9B91486148F2F32AFE31e23#code",2023-05-20,1049513,0,1,Other,Other,TORN,"0x77777feddddffc19ff86db637967013e6c6a116c,0x5efda50f22d34F262c29268506C5Fa42cB56A1Ce"

FilDA contracts on other chains remain unaffected.Details of the ExploitThe compromised funds amount to around 1.6 million USD and were mainly in the form of USDC, HUSD, BUSD, BTC, and ETH. The root cause of the issue is due to the protocol's inability to handle flashloans of ERC677 tokens properly. The attacker used a flashloan to borrow the underlying token, which was then deposited into the protocol via a callback function controlled by the attacker. This resulted in lots of extra f tokens being minted. The borrowed token was then returned to the protocol via a flashloan callback, but lots of fTokens were left to the attacker, allowing them to redeem most of the cash in the lending pool.

The exploit was possible due to a vulnerable 'swap' function that allowed anyone to perform malicious swaps and fully drain the pool.Details of the ExploitSwapos is a DEX running on the Ethereum chain. The project offered decentralized trading with low fees. On the day Swapos V2 Contracts were deployed, a vulnerability was discovered in their 'swap' function which allowed an attacker to execute malicious swaps and fully drain all three pools, including SWP/WETH, USDC/WETH, USDC/WBTC. In total, 464,026 $USD worth of assets were stolen from these pools. Interestingly, the exploiter executed a transaction after a hack with a message reading ""safe"", suggesting they may be a whitehat hacker attempting to bring attention to this vulnerability rather than committing outright theft.

The protocol experienced a hack due to a price manipulation attack on the Optimism layer-two chain. The attacker deployed malicious smart contract with unverified source code, and then donated 200 $WBTC to inflate hWBTC's exchange rate so that even a tiny amount (2 wei) of $hWBTC could drain current lending pools. The attacker then borrows 500 $WBTC from Aave and deposited into the pool and borrowed funds from all pools because of the inflated price of $hWBTC. Consequently, 500 $WTBC was redeemed back for nothing, which caused the attacker contract being liquidated. This resulted in 6,701,157 $USD worth of cryptocurrency being drained from their lending pools.

The attacker used two associated accounts to execute the exploit. The attacker added margin to these two accounts and gradually established large opposite positions for option BTCUSD-40000-C for both accounts by trading relatively small volumes for each turn. Due to the low margin requirement for far OTM options on Deri Protocol, the attacker repeated this process hundreds of times until they opened a huge long position for account A (notional=100,192 BTC) and a huge short position for account B (notional=-96,940 BTC). With everlasting options’ funding mechanism, Account A continuously paid funding fees to B which pushed up the positive net volume causing higher funding rates making it likely that Account A would get liquidated unless BTC price kept going up. At UTC time 10/28/2022 17:51 when BTC price went down and brought Account A under maintenance margin it got liquidated causing massive sell notional=100,192.4024 $BTC which dragged mark price below zero leading to a loss of around $144k USD but only lost original balance as opposed to full loss due bound by margin balance.Immediately after liquidation of A; the attacker closed out short position in B resulting in large profits for 144,532 $USDC.The pool ended up with a net loss since although theoretically B’s profit came from A’s loss but since losses were bound by margin balances and could not be fully realized thus resulted in negative PnL.Block Data ReferenceAttacker addresses:https://arbiscan.io/address/0x09ca80536f5aa6f04a8170D44aAf9fdfDD1e228dhttps://arbiscan.io/address/0x2443506117e03136727E394F85B5b0797A3E0477_Malicious Transaction:https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xc31ade492c134388fef8fdd7669c9bb195c1426697c418d27d45ce9a837bc93d",2022-10-28,144532,0,5,Exchange (DEX),Other,Unknown,0xde3447eb47ecdf9b5f90e7a6960a14663916cee8

The vulnerability led to losses of nearly 3,505,000 $USD from the user named sifuvision.eth . The hack was caused by a smart contract bug on SushiSwap's RouterProcessor2 contract, which allowed attackers to pass security checks and withdrew affected user's approved tokens. The incident affected users who swapped on the platform within four days before detection.After detecting the exploit, Jared Grey, head developer at SushiSwap urged users to revoke permissions for all contracts on their platform while they worked with security teams to mitigate issues.An interesting part of the story is, the initial hack of 100 $ETH was performed by white hat, that tweeted about the vulnerability and returned 90 $ETH back. But several EOA addresses used the same vulnerability to exploit the same user for bigger amount of 1,790 $ETH.Jared Grey, announced the returning of 300 $ETH with the help of the community, and is working on to return 700 $ETH from Lido Vault.Block Data ReferenceAttacker addresses:https://etherscan.io/address/0xfde0d1575ed8e06fbf36256bcdfa1f359281455ahttps://etherscan.io/address/0xc0ffeebabe5d496b2dde509f9fa189c25cf29671Malicious Transaction examples:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x04b166e7b4ab5105a8e9c85f08f6346de1c66368687215b0e0b58d6e5002bc32https://etherscan.io/tx/0xea3480f1f1d1f0b32283f8f282ce16403fe22ede35c0b71a732193e56c5c45e8",2023-04-09,3505950,723450,1,Exchange (DEX),Other,SUSHI,"0x044b75f554b886a065b9567891e45c79542d7357,0xD75F5369724b513b497101fb15211160c1d96550,0x5097CBB61D3C75907656DC4e3bbA892Ff136649a,0xbACEB8eC6b9355Dfc0269C18bac9d6E2Bdc29C4F"

3435,MEV Boost Exploit,MEV Boost Exploit,"Quick SummaryMEV-Boost Relay was exploited by the validator and resulted in a loss of 26,123,300 $USD.Details of the ExploitMEV-Boost Relay is a software for PoS Ethereum used to implement Proposal/Builder separation. A malicious validator exploited a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost Relay and drained five MEV bots. Attack Vector starts from the exploiter to trigger MEV bots to buy already prepared tokens from UniV2 pools. Consequently, the validator executed transactions, front-running the bots. When the MEV bot tries to take profit, the attacker sets both the parent root and state root to zero of the block, making it impossible for the block to be accepted by the network after being signed correctly by proposers. As a result, they could take revealed transactions from deconstructed bundles and claim liquidity from unlucky MEV bots included in that block. Approximately, 26,123,300 $USD worth of $WETH, $WBTC, $USDT, and $DAI were siphoned out from the affected contracts.The patch was rolled out shortly after this incident where now mev-boost-relay will refuse to return transactions if blocks are not successfully sent into networks. In addition, there is now an added delay of one second before responding with any transaction data.Further investigation led to evidence suggesting malicious actors three EOA addresses funded just 25 days ago were used as part of planning and preparing various token pools. Three out of five affected bots had their entire balances drained due to automated strategies working against them when bought tokens without regard for price impact.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address:https://etherscan.io/address/0xf489bd7bc0589ae10c6dd7f39eb429f3aace746eMalicious block:https://etherscan.io/txs?block=16964664Contract holding funds:https://etherscan.io/address/0x3c98d617db017f51C6A73a13E80E1FE14cD1D8Ebhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x5B04db6Dd290F680Ae15D1107FCC06A4763905b6https://etherscan.io/address/0x27bf8f099Ad1eBb2307DF1A7973026565f9C8f69Draining transaction example:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa34d79cbe9aef1bf07692885b353d85912523dfc4662611d33dd09ff6c319c85",2023-04-02,26123300,0,1,Other,Other,Unknown,"0x00000000008c4fb1c916e0c88fd4cc402d935e7d,0x000000000035b5e5ad9019092c665357240f594e,0x00000000003b3cc22af3ae1eac0440bcee416b40,0xe8c060f8052e07423f71d445277c61ac5138a2e5"

3387,Shata Capital,Shata Capital,"Quick SummaryUSDC vault owned by Shata Capital was exploited for about of 5M USD.Details of the ExploitOn February 24, 2023, an exploit was discovered in Shata Capital's EFVault contract, resulting in approximately $5.14 million in losses due to improper configuration after contract upgrade.The attacker's address was 0xa0959536560776ef8627da14c6e8c91e2c743a0a and the attacked contract was 0x80cB73074A6965F60DF59BF8fA3CE398Ffa2702c.The attacker initially deposited 0.1 Ether to the EFVault contract 27 days prior to the attack to get a number of shares.The EFVault contract had been upgraded by proxy before the attack, and the key parameter of the new function redeem in the upgraded contract was directly assigned by reading the wrong value from the corresponding storage location of the agent contract before the upgrade.This resulted in an excessive amount of user withdrawable assets calculated in the redeem function, allowing the hacker to exploit this vulnerability and call the redeem function twice, profiting $3.43 million and $1.71 million respectively.The vulnerability occurred because the initialize function of the newly implemented contract could not be called again after the upgrade, making it impossible to initialize the new variables.In addition, the data storage structure of the old version was not taken into account when adding new variables in the new contract, which resulted in the new contract still reading the data of the proxy contract slot of 0xcc when reading the assetDecimal variable.Through querying the transactions, it was found that the value of maxDeposit can be set by calling the setMaxDeposit function, and the latest value of maxDeposit was set to 5000000000000.The attacker has exchanged all funds to ETH and transferred to tornado.cash.Block Data ReferenceExploit TXs:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1fe5a53405d00ce2f3e15b214c7486c69cbc5bf165cf9596e86f797f62e81914https://etherscan.io/tx/0x31565843d565ecab7ab65965d180e45a99d4718fa192c2f2221410f65ea03743Exploiter:https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0959536560776ef8627da14c6e8c91e2c743a0aAttacker contract:https://etherscan.io/address/0x80cB73074A6965F60DF59BF8fA3CE398Ffa2702c",2023-02-24,5000000,0,1,Other,Access Control,Unknown,Not Available
3386,Saddle Finance,Saddle Finance,"Quick SummarySaddle Finance, an automated market maker (AMM) on Ethereum, suffered an attack on April 30, 2022, which exploited smart contracts and resulted in roughly $11m of crypto being stolenDetails of the ExploitSaddle Finance, an automated market maker (AMM) on Ethereum, experienced a series of transactions on April 30, 2022, which resulted in the loss of roughly $11 million worth of cryptocurrency. The attack was carried out in three transactions, with one of them being a whitehat who managed to rescue approximately 25% of the total amount taken. The exploit was made possible due to a previously known bug that had not been properly patched. Saddle Finance is an AMM that focuses on stable swaps of assets that are pegged or similar in nature. It uses concepts from Curve, which has two distinct swap pools: Standard and Meta. The Meta pool allows liquidity in one pool to be used in additional pools. The root cause of the attack on Saddle Finance was the inconsistent price calculations of assets within its Meta pool. The mispricing was caused by the omission of math that calculates the value of tokens given, based upon the base virtual price of the LP token. The bug was present within the library called MetaSwapUtils, which is used for calculating swaps, deposits, and withdrawals. Despite the protocol's quick reaction to the exploit and the migration to a supposedly fixed MetaSwapUtils library, the incorrect swap calculation present in the original code was still present in live pools.Block Data ReferenceExploit TXs:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b023d65485c4bb68d781960c2196588d03b871dc9eb1c054f596b7ca6f7da56https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe7e0474793aad11875c131ebd7582c8b73499dd3c5a473b59e6762d4e373d7b8Exploiter:https://etherscan.io/address/0x63341ba917de90498f3903b199df5699b4a55ac0",2022-04-30,11000000,2500000,1,Exchange (DEX),Other,SDL,0x88cc4aa0dd6cf126b00c012dda9f6f4fd9388b17

3384,KLAYswap,KLAYswap,"Quick SummaryExploiters have stolen $1.9m from South Korean cryptocurrency platform KLAYswap using a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).Details of the ExploitAccording to reports, the attackers used a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to manipulate the network flow and configure it in a way that allowed users connected to KLAYswap to download malicious code from the server sent by the attackers instead of the normal software development kit file or KakaoTalk.When a token-related function was executed through the KLAYswap UI on February 3, the researchers found that a malicious external attack occurred due to the infection of SDK files from external sites, which did not originate from KLAYswap's own front-end source code. Instead, the user's normal Kakao SDK JavaScript file request was connected to a third-party server built by the attacker, which was not a Kakao server, that led to an incident in which malicious code files were downloaded.The malicious JavaScript allowed the attackers to intercept funds as a user-initiated transaction. Over a two-hour period, the hackers stole cryptocurrency totaling 2.2 billion won (about $1.9 million) from 407 abnormal transactions from 325 customer wallets.The attackers changed all transaction requests of users to either directly send or approve the user's token to their contract and load it on the KLAYswap site. By changing the Kakao SDK script, the malicious code was created in the form of interfering with the operation of the existing KLAYswap code and allowing its own code to be executed. If a transaction occurred with corrupted logic, the user's assets were approved for use or the assets were transferred directly to the attacker's address.KLAYswap developers say they blocked all functions of KLAYswap and performed an emergency check to prevent further damage after the incident was identified. They also restricted the operation of Klaytn minter, a blockchain platform in the bridge, to prevent the transfer of stolen assets to other exchange platforms through the Orbit Bridge.South Korean cybersecurity firm S2W analyzed the attack and found that the malicious code was distributed only to users who accessed it through KLAYswap by checking the referrer value of the HTTP header when connecting.

The attacker exploited a previously unknown vulnerability and minted $USK to buy their own $ETH back from themselves at an unusually expensive rate. This exploit caused $230,000 of bad debt to be accrued by this contract. In the USK Margin contract instead of providing collateral and minting $USK, users provide $USK, and the contract is permitted to mint $USK and then swap the total amount for the collateral asset.A bug in the USK Margin contract meant it considered $ETH to be worth significantly more than the market rate when opening a new position, allowing the exploiter to place limit orders for their own $ETH at a little less than 10,000 $USK each. They then opened large margin positions, which minted $USK, and bought their own $ETH back from themselves, at nearly 6x the market rate. This $USK was then sold for $USDC and extracted from the network. The attacker sold a total of 58 $ETH, and the USK Margin contract has a total debt of 335,000 $USK, equating to roughly $236,000 $USD. In order to guarantee that $USK is fully collateralized - the Kujira Team has placed a single limit order on the USDC-USK pair for 245,000 $USDC at a price of 1.01.

3347,Numbers Protocol,Numbers Protocol,"Quick SummaryOn the 23rd Of Nov, 2022, the Numbers Protocol was exploited, resulting in the loss of approximately 13,836 $USD.Details of the ExploitOn November 23, 2022, an attack occurred on the Numbers Protocol ($NUM token) on the Ethereum chain, resulting in a loss of approximately $13,836. The root cause of the vulnerability was because the NUM token was incompatible with the Multichain, a cross-chain router protocol. The NUM token lacked a permit function required by the Router protocol, but it did have a default callback function which allowed forged signature to be passed in to trick the cross-chain bridge into transferring the user's assets. The attacker created a fake token using the attack contract which used $NUM as its underlying token, then called the anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit function of the Multi-Chain Router contract to drain 557,754.45000198 $NUM tokens from one of the victim users. This function should generally pass in token, and call the permit function of the underlying token for signature approval, before exchanging the token of the authorized user to the specified address. In this case, since the $NUM token contract didn’t have a permit function, but it did have a callback function, which means that when an attacker sent in a fake signature, the callback function would return normally, so the transaction wouldn't fail. Eventually, this allowed the $NUM token at the victim address to be transferred to the specified attack contract. The attacker then used Uniswap to convert the stolen $NUM tokens into $USDC and then into WETH. The attack was front-run by a bot, which paid the builder approximately 10 ETH out of the entire profit.Block Data ReferenceAttacker TX:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8a8145ab28b5d2a2e61d74c02c12350731f479b3175893de2014124f998bff32",2022-11-23,13836,0,1,NFT,Other,NUM,0x3496b523e5c00a4b4150d6721320cddb234c3079

The hack was made possible by a logical vulnerability that allowed the attacker to exploit the transfer function, which gave them twice the rewards if the sender and recipient were a pair.The attacker exploited the vulnerability by obtaining a 1,400 WBNB flash loan before exchanging 1,000 WBNB for 10.5K BRA tokens. They then transferred all the acquired BRA tokens to the Pancakeswap pair. Next, they used the ""skim()"" function and invoked the BRA contract's transfer function to receive rewards. The ""skim()"" function acts as a recovery mechanism if the number of tokens supplied to a pair exceeds the two uint112 storage spaces for reserves.In this case, the attacker provided the pair as the recipient address, and BRA reverted to the pair, resulting in the doubling of the BRA amount after a single skim. The attacker repeated this method 100 times, which led to a significant increase in the contract pair's BRA balance.The attacker then returned 1.675K WBNB tokens and repaid the 1.4K WBNB token flash loan, which generated a profit of 675 WBNB that was sent to their address.

The attacker used flashloans to borrow WETH and swapped it into ETH, then added liquidity to the wstETH/ETH pool on Curve, earning wstETHCRV tokens. They deposited some of the tokens in the Curve wstETHCRV-gauge, receiving wstETHCRV-gauge tokens, which were used to deposit in the dForce wstETH/ETH Vault and mint share tokens and USX tokens. The attacker then removed liquidity using the remove_liquidity function, which triggered the fallback function of the attack contract, ultimately decreasing the virtual price in the wstETH/ETH pool. The attacker then liquidated other users in the dForce wstETH/ETH Vault, profiting from the manipulated virtual price. The hacked funds are still in the attacker's address as of now. The root cause was the attacker's exploitation of the process of transferring native tokens before burning LP when removing liquidity in the wstETH/ETH Pool, triggering the callback for receiving native tokens to manipulate virtual prices and liquidate other users for profit.Block Data ReferenceExploit TXs:https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x6c19762186c9f32c81eb2a79420fc7ad4485aa916cab37ec278b216757bfba0dhttps://phalcon.blocksec.com/tx/arbitrum/0x5db5c2400ab56db697b3cc9aa02a05deab658e1438ce2f8692ca009cc45171dd",2023-02-10,3650000,0,5,Yield Aggregator,Oracle Issue,DF,"0xdfec2ea848cf8fda096503f8d9f37afac6e0ecf2,0x2ce498b79c499c6bb64934042eba487bd31f75ea"

This exploit was made possible through validators' usage of outdated oracle software.Details of the ExploitThe Mirror Protocol was a synthetic assets protocol that allowed users to deposit $USTC or $LUNAC with a lockup period in order to mint synthetic stocks and commodities. It is noteworthy that the new Terra Network was launched within days after the collapse of the Terra Classic Network.

While the new Luna coin was trading at a price around 5$ at the time, the $LUNAC coin was practically worthless at a price point of fractions of a cent. This meant that for $1k in $LUNC an attacker could deposit $1,3 million in deposit and borrow against it. Due to this mechanism, attackers drained several pools on the platform.Block Data ReferenceExample Transaction: https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/F830681D8FEACC4DA67E84D40C49F0FF805609F2BB5CCC39A0EFE66257F2D791",2022-05-31,2000000,0,22,"Borrowing and Lending,Other",Oracle Issue,MIR,"https://etherscan.io/address/0x09a3EcAFa817268f77BE1283176B946C4ff2E608, https://bscscan.com/address/0x5B6DcF557E2aBE2323c48445E8CC948910d8c2c9, https://finder.terra.money/classic/address/terra15gwkyepfc6xgca5t5zefzwy42uts8l2m4g40k6"

3121,Curve.Finance,Curve.Finance,"Quick SummaryAn attacker managed to compromise the Curve Finance website through a DNS attack and made away with approx. $612k worth of stablecoins.Details of the ExploitCurve.Finance is a backbone DeFi application, which does not only serve as a main focal point for institutional players with its stablecoin pools but also revolutionized Tokenomics by introducing the $CRV token rewards.An attacker managed to compromise the Curve.Finance website and redirect users to a malicious website, that extracted funds out of users wallets that interacted with it. This example transaction shows how the malicious smart contract transferred funds out of a users wallet to the attacker https://etherscan.io/tx/0x525fb894ed485b2cbdbdfaccedc3d405ba0f4659816ca4b639be7dd22e31a5e4.At the time of this writing  362.8 ETH has flown out of the attackers wallet, with the majority of funds flowing to the CEX's FixedFloat (292 ETH) and Binance (20 ETH).Curve.Finance found the problem and fixed it and urges all its users to check if any approvals to the malicious smart contract were given

3119,GenomesDAO,GenomesDAO,"Quick SummaryGenomesDao was attacked. Three smart contracts were attacked and the amount that was stolen by the hacker is approximately $43k.Details of the ExploitGenomesDAO is a DAO focused on secure, private and verifiable monetization of genomic data using DeFi. There was a vulnerability in the contract due to which an hacker can repeatedly invoke ""victim"" contracts. The hacker first created fake LP tokens and using the initialization function, he was able to install a real LP contract token on a fake one.The hacker then supplied a fake token using the shake function to get the LP tokens of the contract. Then the hacker uses the initialization function to return to the original LP-token and revokes the real LP of the contract using the output function.Thus, the hacker was able to take a profit of about $43k.Block Data ReferenceVictim addresses:1) https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3606cFa43f53098BC00b3FCFF3A333F6947F3c922) https://polygonscan.com/address/0x28fc73E9D9f158E7DC57A4E81aa0175d6847f7143) https://polygonscan.com/address/0x48D1CcB09f771788F59c8aAAB613936eDfA267b7Attacker address: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x43ec1d163cc4c15b574f86d8203c3b0f3ebed7a3Attacker smart contract addresses:1) https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8e10c9493501a828304d77630b6f862bbf50c0522) (Token) https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9aa63491bb927f024d37b0e6017137f7f03da3c6Transactions:Swap $AnyMATIC to blockchain $MATIC: https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x074f3076ea2c16ef34b15114e751dcdc044ee2e9a26d762a2e96bf97a4509311",2022-08-06,43269,0,3,NFT,Other,GENE,0x34667ED7C36cBBbF2d5d5c5c8d6Eb76a094EDb9F
3118,EvoDeFi Bridge,EvoDeFi Bridge,"Quick SummaryThe EvoDefi Bridge minted assets without backing. This approach has lead to users losing possible upwards of $66 million in assets.Details of the ExploitThe EvoDeFi Bridge connects a plethora of blockchains such as Avalanche, BSC, Heco, Fantom, Gnosis, Moonriver, Ethereum and Oasis Emerald. The incident gained traction when twitter users noticed a gap between 83 million $USDT and 33 million USDC that were minted on the Oasis Emerald blockchain with only 10.6 million $USDT and $10.2 million USDC.The gap was massive in these two assets. Other assets existed in the bridge that were overcollateralized in contrast. EvoDefi offers a wide suite of DeFi products including DEX's. ValleySwap on the Oasis Emerald network. According to rugdoc the EvoDeFi team decided to mint unbacked USDT and deposit user funds into the anchor protocol in order to be able to offer high APRs on Valleswap. This strategy backfired with the downfall of the Terra Ecosystem.The bridge had to be paused and questions regarding missing funds could not be addressed appropriately by the team.Block Data ReferenceEvoDeFi Bridge address:https://bscscan.com/address/0x9983d8cdeaf7872501628229d311e2f7df396add",2022-06-07,66000000,0,2,Bridge,Other,Unknown,Not Available

He admitted that in order to attract investors, he falsified some aspects of official TBIS documents. He also posted fake customer reviews on the TBIS website and falsely claimed that he had business relationships with well-known companies in order to create a false appearance of legality. Like most blockchain projects, TBIS outlined its plans in a whitepaper, promising that its BAR token would be useful for accessing a platform offering real services. TBIS stated that there was a major hack of BAR, and issued a second coin, TBAR, to replace it. However, the original BAR coin continued to be traded on exchanges. Titanium was one of several ICO projects that attracted fraud allegations around 2017 and 2018 during a surge in coin-based fundraising, and the SEC even created its own fake website to warn buyers about the fraud. Today, most of the alleged fraud is related to projects of non-interchangeable tokens or NFT, but the legal system is still catching up with ICOs. Stollery is due to be sentenced in November 2022, where the fraud charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.",2022-07-27,21000000,0,Not Available,Other,Rugpull,Unknown,Not Available

Slope Wallet developers used Sentry to transfer data to the network. By default, Sentry does not use 2FA from which it can be concluded that most likely the Sentry Slope account was compromised, and since the data storage period in Sentry is 90 days, and it is possible to track the data of users who created their accounts in this period of time, the hacker gained access to the clean data of users' wallets such as mnemonic and private key. The vulnerability was also noticed in mobile devices based on android and iOS, most likely the application was written using the Flutter framework, which contains a bug, so the hacker also had access to private user data.Block Data ReferenceHacker account address:(SOL) 1) https://solscan.io/account/GeEccGJ9BEzVbVor1njkBCCiqXJbXVeDHaXDCrBDbmuy(SOL) 2) https://solscan.io/account/5WwBYgQG6BdErM2nNNyUmQXfcUnB68b6kesxBywh1J3n(SOL) 3) https://solscan.io/account/CEzN7mqP9xoxn2HdyW6fjEJ73t7qaX9Rp2zyS6hb3iEu(SOL) 4) https://solscan.io/account/Htp9MGP8Tig923ZFY7Qf2zzbMUmYneFRAhSp7vSg4wxVAddress that received 0.5 $SOL from the Binance Hot Wallet on Solana: https://solscan.io/account/HYaQcKPcWgLe7gpA99EUbDSGuzJCupNVCRXmXP37xYXv#solTransfers(ETH) https://etherscan.io/address/0xc611952D81E4ECbd17c8f963123DeC5D7BCe1c27",2022-08-03,5200000,0,24,Other,Other,Unknown,Not Available

The initial attack appears to have taken place with this transaction, where 100 (WBTC) were extracted from the protocol; https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61497a1a8a8659a06358e130ea590e1eed8956edbd99dbb2048cfb46850a8f17. This hack was made possible by an operational error incurred by the team, which had been found and commented upon in an audit report made by Quantstamp. Essentially, at the initialization of the contract the ""process()"" function checks messages for an acceptable merkle root. The team accidentally marked the zero root (0x00) as acceptable. This error enabled every message to be auto-proven by default. Essentially, the attacker was able to process transactions without any proving by calling the function ""process()"".This information spread within the community and all that was needed to participate in the looting of the protocol was finding a transaction that worked and copy-pasting the transaction with the wallet of desire at the receiving end. This is the reason why tokens were predominantly extracted in the exact same denomination.The initial attack was followed by hundreds of EOA`s extracting assets such as $WBTC, $FXS, $C3, $DAI, $USDC from the bridge. Amongst the looters were reputable hackers from other exploits such as the Rari Capital Exploiter as well as White hat hackers who intend to return the funds.As the time of this writing approx. $32 million have been returned to the Nomad Recovery Funds Address https://etherscan.io/address/0x94A84433101A10aEda762968f6995c574D1bF154 by white hat hackers and cooperating culprits.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x56d8b635a7c88fd1104d23d632af40c1c3aac4e3Attacker contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf57113d8f6ff35747737f026fe0b37d4d7f42777Attack transactions: 1) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61497a1a8a8659a06358e130ea590e1eed8956edbd99dbb2048cfb46850a8f172) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x29b67e0701ddd910ff6a069aa039015eb78b1ee6d99ad8da5d0ef63916f3fd573) https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdf6bef0d8dee8b44863ac61092a711b877dcfe3d61da93d7289e0c6285af1b454) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3dbed4a1ebb2289273370ce0ef10302882927abe946299cf2ca3073f1a3dcdd9Nomad Recovery Funds Address:https://etherscan.io/address/0x94A84433101A10aEda762968f6995c574D1bF154",2022-08-01,190000000,36342325,1,Bridge,Other,Nomad: ERC20 Bridge,0x88a69b4e698a4b090df6cf5bd7b2d47325ad30a3

This platform allows users to stake NFT tokens to receive fungible tokens e.g. $ETH. The attacker deposited NFTs from the collection Doodles that were used as a collateral to borrow $WETH. Then the attacker exploited a vulnerability in order to execute a reentrancy attack by withdrawing all NFTs deposited as collateral by the attacker except for one NFT. This action triggered a malicious callback function that allowed the attacker to buy more Doodles before  liquidating the loan position: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x05d65e0adddc5d9ccfe6cd65be4a7899ebcb6e5ec7a39787971bcc3d6ba73996When the position is liquidated, the remaining Doodle NFT from the collateral were returned to the attacker. The credit position is liquidated because NFT value from initial collateral is insufficient to cover the debt position.

3062,Horizon by Harmony,Horizon by Harmony,"Quick SummaryHarmony's Horizon Bridge was exploited by an attacker resulting in losses of roughly $100M. The bridge was secured by multisig wallet which needed 2 out of 5 wallets to confirm transaction. The hacker gained control over 2 wallets which enabled the attacker to drain the funds of the bridge and transfer said funds to his wallet.Details of the Exploit For yet unspecified reasons the attacker gained access over 2 of the 5 multisig wallets.The attacker was able to enter and confirm transactions by himself. The exploit resulted in the loss of: ETH, USDC, WBTC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, AAG, FXS, SUSHI, AAVE, WETH, and FRAX. The ONE token was not affected by this attack.For more context, bridges in DeFi are used to enable interoperability between blockchains. Through bridges a user of DeFi may pursue opportunities in an ecosystem that is not native to the coins or tokens a user is holding. For example through Harmony's Horizon Bridge a user holding $ETH on the Ethereum network could bridge $ETH over to the Harmony blockchain receiving newly minted wrapped $1ETH on a 1:1 ratio. Since the funds on the bridge were seized by the attacker, the receipt was no longer backed by the collateral on a 1:1 ratio. The depreciation of the wrapped assets were felt by users in the form of massive slippages on dexes and other bridges as users tried to flee the Harmony Ecosystem.Below a breakdown of the specific function used by the attacker.1) The multisig owner called the submitTransaction(), then to confirm owner calls confirmTransaction() from the MultiSigWallet with the input transactionId 21106.2) The executeTransaction() function has made an external call with input that will call the unlockEth() function in the Ethmanager contract. The input specifies the amount, recipient, and receiptId to be passed to the unlockEth() function.3) The following steps were repeated with different ids.Block Data ReferenceAttacker transactions:640K BUSD: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4ed7941394725e49e7423e56553901c4ce841792c70e87adeee282cd78500668Link to attacker draining bridge for ERC20 tokens: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d043128146654c7683fbf30ac98d7b2285ded00#tokentxnsMultisig wallet addresses that were compromised:1) https://etherscan.io/address/0xf845a7ee8477ad1fb4446651e548901a2635a9152) https://etherscan.io/address/0x812d8622c6f3c45959439e7ede3c580da06f8f25These addresses confirmed the transaction with id 21108.

3061,Inverse Finance,Inverse Finance (1),"Quick SummaryInverse Finance was exploited due to price manipulation, resulting in a loss of approximately $14.5M in assets.Details of the ExploitInverse Finance, a DeFi platform, was exploited due to the manipulation of the 'external price oracle'. The attacker purchased INV tokens and manipulated the price to overestimate its value. This allowed the attacker to borrow 1588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 3999669 DOLA, and 39 YFI, which significantly exceeded their initial INV investment. The attacker deployed a malicious smart contract and used SushiSwap and Curve.fi to manipulate the price. Due to the small liquidity of SushiSwap on the INV/ETH pair, an exchange for 300 ETH was enough to change the price of the INV token. The attacker then deposited the funds in INV received at the preparation stage and minted 1746 XINV tokens. With the rise in the price of XINV, the attacker was able to borrow assets using the minted XINV tokens.Block Data ReferenceExploiter Addresses:https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b4c1083cd6aef062298e1fa900df9832c8351b3https://etherscan.io/address/0x117c0391b3483e32aa665b5ecb2cc539669ea7e9Malicious Contract Address:https://etherscan.io/address/0xea0c959bbb7476ddd6cd4204bdee82b790aa1562Malicious Transaction:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x20a6dcff06a791a7f8be9f423053ce8caee3f9eecc31df32445fc98d4ccd8365",2022-04-02,14500000,0,1,Borrowing and Lending,Oracle Issue,INV,0x41D5D79431A913C4aE7d69a668ecdfE5fF9DFB68

3058,Terra Classic,Terra Classic,"Quick SummaryA complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network. Details of the ExploitThe Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.Block Data ReferenceWhale Addresses:https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0ahttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784",2022-05-08,40000000000,0,22,Stablecoin,Other,"LUNC, USTC","0xa47c8bf37f92abed4a126bda807a7b7498661acd,0x7e43d25EaD96B1058f671F6690ea705BA2C7e5B9"

Then WBTC was added as liquidity to the Curve pool.2) The obtained LP tokens were deposited to the Yearn’s Vault. Yearn’s Vault tokens were deposited to Inverse Finance’s Yearn 3Crypto Vault to serve as collateral on Inverse Finance.3) The attacker's then uses the remaining 26,775 WBTC of the initial flashloan to swap for 75M USDT on Curve 3Crypto. It manipulates the pricing oracle that let's the attacker is then able to borrow $10M worth of Dola USD StableCoin.4) Then, the 75M USDT is swapped for 26,626 WBTC.5) The attacker then uses the borrowed DOLA to provide liquidity to the Curve Metapool. When the liquidity is ~10.1M USDT, it is removed.6) Then, it converts 10M USDT to 451 WBTC using the 3Crypto pool on Curve.

3040,Maiar DEX,Maiar DEX,"Quick SummaryMaiar DEX was the victim of an attack by hackers who found and exploited a vulnerability in order to empty the reserves of the protocol. Due to this vulnerability, when a $WEGLD contract called a Maiar contract, it allowed Maiar to perform a token transfer in the context of the $WEGLD contract, the calling party. Maiar DEX was successfully recovered by the Elrond team, and user funds were not affectedDetails of the ExploitThe Maiar DEX protocol was attacked by hackers who took advantage of a vulnerability in the WEGLD contract to steal funds from the protocol on the Elrond network. The attacker's accounts were created almost simultaneously and tokens in the amount of 1.959 $EGLD were sent to each of them from Binance Hot Wallet:Block Data Reference1) https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/ba7bcea55911973556c0c855a912c868e76a658792b62a6688c16a14c98a01022) https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/27935d8bceaee5b179bddb1dcd9683a3c227055c8ac70b4bd5f3a40a2b5f6dd13) https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/73f39d3edf0cf5f0893fa3a8175f614329960572e2843f6a21f60b5e1bf778f5After the accounts were created and smart contracts as well, they called the withdraw() function and received a total of 1,650,000 $EGLD. The most important here is the wrat_egls_callback() function. This function enables the wrapping and unwrapping of the $EGLD token.In the transaction below, it can be noticed that as the new smart contract sends a small amount of $EGLD to the wrapEgId() method and this method sends $WEDLD to the wrap_edId_callback() method of the new contract:https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/848b5a96bd95d3537f2bb8cfc5c1ebc5ec580e72214dd75c85be718ae0bbf3fb#4159433916247dbdbfbbf31d8a4cc8ce14a3a86e5a5f7beb1cddcf5abc59b83eDeploying the wrap_egId_callback() method, was found a call of the managedExecuteOnDestContextByCaller() method, which allows attacker to ""ask"" the victim's contract to send funds to any other address that the attacker indicates, which happened during the attack on Maiar DEX. The Elrond team paused the work of Maiar DEX, they also froze stablecoins so that the hacker would not be able to withdraw funds through the bridge to another network. Having connections with other major exchanges, they handed over a blacklist with addresses so that the fraudster would not be able to withdraw funds. The executeOnDestContextByCaller() function was removed to avoid a repeat attack. Then the team began to restore the liquidity pool by returning all funds and restoring the price of the token, based on the price indicated by Binance.Block Data ReferenceAttacker addresses:1) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1cura2qq8skel5fsxrpxyysjkaw6durengtkencrezkw78y6y2zhscf854j2) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1yrf9qeuqkcjeh5c4xn628mags7cse4r9ra2p2ggmlgfqq3l3v6pqxfu9503) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd16syfkds2faezhqa7pn5n8fyjkst70l5qefpmc0r960467snlgycq4ww0rtContract addresses:1) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgq85hhnppjcdamledp3usgkm3lm832jekw2zhsajjztn2) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqqucnpav4dguh4zf6nvd48l68k2nxhyu0v6pqqntgfs3) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqll7yerx6v67p0s8va0h09dgv7x30nlergycqt2qzmpContract deployment transaction by the attacker address (erd1...854j): https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/9404479926078441d8fd8844ec4787c4c35c554628abdc7605c8084f49299352 Contract deployment transaction by the attacker address (erd1...u950): https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/39c7aebfe5ebbe4bcc285ef5cc99869486705afa4ce94071c5aafc6124864fb7Contract deployment transaction by the attacker address (erd1...ww0rt): https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqll7yerx6v67p0s8va0h09dgv7x30nlergycqt2qzmpTransactions of theft of funds from the Maiar DEX:400k EGLD: https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/8b8c332577e5b8bdd4e13450ea92b7c6b0ca15399f1f0bb38fc215cfc3ddb490450k EGLD: https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/39998ab5c929fa67e95d0c64081697fc4207235dbfeaaff10fb2704a6c7716b6800k EGLD: https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/41effd8536376f3a2edba7074c02776edae94bb5b464485ac414847202eebbe2Recovered funds were send to one of Elrond addresses: https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1pml9k2tsqsnvtmmalglt2su0sn3cguvr8e8jq0gy69zw2ldcej2qapml9a",2022-06-05,113000000,113000000,Not Available,Exchange (DEX),Other,MEX,https://elrondscan.com/token/MEX-455c57

It was launched in November 2011 as First Pirate Savings & Trust. Pirate claimed to have been selling bitcoins to some local tight-lipped buyers, and that he started BST to provide more volume to these buyers. By selling invested bitcoins at a high rate and rebuying them at the market price, Pirate was supposedly able to offer a very high-yield interest rate of 7% per week. This rate attracted many investors, and Pirate claimed that over 500,000 bitcoins had been deposited.After accumulating an ever-larger amount of bitcoin, transactions were becoming difficult and expensive. Pirate attempted to reduce the strain by lowering the interest rate, but this sparked unrest and mass withdrawals. After a discussion with his clients, Pirate decided to close BST and announced his intentions to return all owned bitcoins. After repaying at least 11 small beneficiaries, BST suddenly announced a default on August 28, 2012. It was later revealed that the missing money went towards ""rent, car-related expenses, utilities, retail purchases, casinos, and meals.""",2012-07-02,4630000,0,Not Available,CeFi,Rugpull,Unknown,Not Available

This feature was intended to be implemented on the next dApp update, however, it’s been around for about 1 month on the contract side.The issue is in the line below, which assumes that there can not be a malicious smart contract on the pool that is called on receiveHop(_pool):tokenPool.stakingToken.approve(address(_newPool),tokenPool.stakingToken.totalSupply());By approving the totalSupply to the new pool, Contract B was able to have allowance to spend the staking contract tokens. This basically means they were able to withdraw them from the staking contract at a whim once that initial setup was made.The attacker:- created contract A- created contract B- the attacker contract then proceeded to buy some EarnHub, stake it, and make it hop to contract B (makeHop(contractBaddress))- after receiving the hop, the contract was able to drain the funds from the staking contract by just using the transferFrom() function repeated times.The example transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x40e69064c70d7db8b2dcbad441da9a06a507f8f90959da3c2583242f89e01d3cStolen funds were deposited into Tornado Cash mixer:https://explorer.bitquery.io/bsc/address/0x3d98aee279c82d8178b87d9d4dc442d65224dacc/outflow",2022-02-07,244938,0,2,Yield Aggregator,Other,EHB,0x80cba4031f7a75b650f4146e5ceba9d7562df939

2805,Qubit Finance,Qubit Finance,"Quick SummaryQubit Finance lending protocol was hacked due to smart contract vulnerability. The hacker minted $xETH tokens to steal 80,000,000 worth of $BNBDetails of the Exploit Qubit Finance is DeFi protocol for lending and borrowing on both Ethereum and Binance SmartChain. The protocol confirmed a hack on Twitter, 206,809 $BNB was stolen which was worth 80,000,000 $USD up to that time. The attack flow is below:The attacker:- funded his wallet with 0.8887725 ETH from Tornado Cash- sent 16 deposit transactions to QBridge of Ethereum- sent 16 voteProposal transactions to QBridge contract of BSC by Qubit Relayer - a number of $xETH tokens were minted by 16 voteProposal transactions, and liquidity in Qubit was withdrawn using this as collateral.The attacker called the QBridge deposit function on the Ethereum network, which calls the deposit function QBridgeHandler. QBridgeHandler should receive the $WETH token, which is the original tokenAddress, and if the person who performed the tx does not have a $WETH token, the transfer should not occur.tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom(depositer, address(this), amount);In the deposit function above, tokenAddress is 0, so safeTransferFrom didn’t fail and the deposit function ended normally regardless of the amount value. Additionally, tokenAddress was the $WETH address before depositETH was added, but as depositETH is added, it is replaced with the zero address that is the tokenAddress of ETH.In summary, the deposit function was a function that should not be used after depositETH was newly developed, but it remained in the contract, which allows the attacker to use this to steal the funds.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address:https://etherscan.io/address/0xD01Ae1A708614948B2B5e0B7AB5be6AFA01325c7",2022-01-27,80000000,0,2,Borrowing and Lending,Other,Unknown,Not Available

2799,OpenSea,OpenSea,"A bug has been exploited to purchase NFTs from users of OpenSea, at well below market value.Was identified at least five attackers who have exploited this loophole to purchase at least twelve NFTs for much less than their market value. These include Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Cool Cats, and Cyberkongz NFTs.The exploit:- when you list an item for sale (or bid) you are signing data that validate that you are willing to sell your NFT at this price- the signature is saved in OpenSea's DB off-chain and when someone wants to buy your NFT, they will send to their smart contract your previously signed data where the signature and sale information (such as expiration & price) are validated on-chain before making the transfer- when you cancel a listing, you are required to perform a transaction. The reason is that someone might save your signed listing (which are public - i.e https://orders.rarible.com or even their API) and use it later, even if the listing got removed from the UI- the transaction on-chain will save the fact that you canceled this sale on their smart contract and even if someone will try to use your signed data from before, the on-chain validation will reject the sale- the bug stems from the fact that previously you could re-list an NFT without canceling it and all the previous listings are not canceled on-chain, this is why re-listing will not workFor example, at around 7 am on January 24, a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT #9991 was purchased for 0.77 ETH ($1,800). This family of NFTs currently sells for at least $198,000.

At the time, one of the protocol's founders contacted investors to notify them that the protocol had been compromised. The creator asked that investors refrain from contacting attorneys or law authorities since doing so would ""slow the recovery process.""However, Africrypt staff lost access to the exchange's back-end systems seven days before the claimed attack, making this report suspect. After receiving notice of the ""hack"" and its odd request not to contact attorneys or law enforcement, several investors hired a law firm Hanekom Attorneys. The investigation discovered that most of the bitcoin invested with the exchange had been withdrawn and moved through tumblers and mixers to make it harder to track. The founders of Africrypt are still at large and have not been found as the time of this writing.",2021-06-23,3600000000,0,Not Available,CeFi,Rugpull,Unknown,Not Available

Previously, when CAKE was staked, an equivalent number of SYRUP tokens were created. The SYRUP tokens would be burnt once the CAKE was unstaked and withdrawn. The exact attack here was that if a user invoked the MasterChef contract's emergencyWithdraw method to withdraw their staked CAKE, the related SYRUP tokens were not burned as planned. This enabled malicious actors to mint additional SYRUP tokens using their CAKE tokens on a regular basis.Because there were much more SYRUP tokens in circulation than was permitted, the bad actors received a larger share of Syrup Pool rewards. ",2020-11-03,0,0,2,Exchange (DEX),Other,CAKE,0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82

The exploiter extracted approx. $USD 1.75M in value from the project.Details of the ExploitBent Finance is a staking and farming platform that optimizes returns from the curve protocol.The Bent Finance team was in the process of migrating its contracts to a multisig wallet hereby effectively addressing internal security issues. Only days before the migration a developer on the team hardcoded the maximum fees on the crv and mim pool contracts to 17%. The developer also introduced a malicious smart contract that enabled the deployer to hardcode users balances.  The exploiter proceeded to assign an enormous balance to his account, far exceeding the TVL of Bent Finance. Subsequently, the developer launched a new smart contract in order to cover his tracks. Through these mechanisms the dishonest deployer was pledged rewards in the billions by the smart contracts. All of the above mentioned proxy updates completely changed the functionality of the smart contracts and would not have been possible a couple of days later after the multisig migration would have concluded. The crooked deployer proceeded to withdraw 513k cvxcrv token and redirected them to a second address.

2710,MonoX,MonoX,"Quick SummaryMonoswap contracts on Polygon and Ethereum were exploited due to a flaw in the swapTokenForExactToken() function, allowing the attackers to inflate the value of the MONO token and drain other tokens from the pool.Details of the ExploitThe attackers exploited a weakness in the swapTokenForExactToken() function in the Monoswap contract, using the same token as tokenIn and tokenOut. This resulted in the price of the MONO token being artificially inflated. The attackers then used this inflated token to swap out almost all of the other tokens in the pool.Stolen funds:- 5.7M MATIC ($10.5M)- 3.9k WETH ($18.2M)- 36.1 WBTC ($2M)- 1.2k LINK ($31k)- 3.1k GHST ($9.1k)- 5.1M DUCK ($257k)- 4.1k MIM ($4.1k)- 274 IMX ($2k)Block Data ReferenceThe attacker's addresses:Polygon: https://polygonscan.com/address/0xecbe385f78041895c311070f344b55bfaa953258Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/address/0xecbe385f78041895c311070f344b55bfaa953258Transactions behind the attack:Polygon: https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x5a03b9c03eedcb9ec6e70c6841eaa4976a732d050a6218969e39483bb3004d5dEthereum: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9f14d093a2349de08f02fc0fb018dadb449351d0cdb7d0738ff69cc6fef5f299",2021-12-01,31400000,0,"1,3",Exchange (DEX),Other,MONO,0x2920f7d6134f4669343e70122cA9b8f19Ef8fa5D

The exploited xFORCE vault is a fork of the xSUSHI contract, which assumes that a failed transfer will result in a reversion.2. The token used in ForceDAO is an Aragon Minime token that returns false if a call to the transferFrom() function fails.The ForceDAO hackers took advantage of this vulnerability: if a deposit into the xFORCE vault fails, the deposited tokens will remain in the sender’s wallet. However, on the vault’s side, the sender will receive xFORCE tokens in exchange because the code assumes that if it’s still running after the transfer, that the transfer went through successfully.Black hat #1:- minted xFORCE:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdf05020d5d3c3a975627ce29f24b4eb8ccb8807f9f9c9aa05e644c61fe5f0141- withdrew FORCE, using minted xFORCE:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3b60252b36d2de2930a64f360926bfcba44d12ff44719de3c6dd486b9dafe118- sold FORCE:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x03c84e3f7d9c117260a49bab6bd9cb1b2d7e1cbc6d9362e74c10ef6d48a987e6Black hat #2:- minted xFORCE:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7df2fe63dfb43676a13146060d36ded98779092e0f7c9fd46caf18b791d4b9fd- withdrew FORCE, using minted xFORCE:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe7be5bf25b0ea9fad2fd51021f4a51e5099cf4c91c2ffef94547072fe25ca8d1- sold FORCE in multiple transactions:https://etherscan.io/address/0xe29a07002c7be4299b51a2892799cc4a372994ddBlack hat #3:- minted xFORCE multiple times:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x37b44d5dbbe9c1dd75223e15977153234e8a4dbbbab2495cdcc531f44bf6e3d0https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6202403f9fc418fcc464d714753ef49893c174a3da714784251ce03898b34f00https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5a27ee4140741fce2dd21ae642a74e95bd3de0df17ba7ae5d9ffc475574135f8- withdrew FORCE, using minted xFORCE:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2616ae9fb59e2cbae848208daa3d0f63530b74a8a4e5c6099ee1b858fdc732a8- sold FORCE in multiple transactions:https://etherscan.io/address/0x0608576ea47b265f1f16b8b8383d0508f703a0cbBlack hat #4:- withdrew FORCE, using minted xFORCE:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8aedc3d1eaef0d63f026dec48d845dfcba2d74211998acb5d19929e4bc020317https://etherscan.io/tx/0xef10be2cbb33ff810cf07bd9195596556485f767744afbb93dfeb5717775ebb6- minted xFORCE multiple times:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xef10be2cbb33ff810cf07bd9195596556485f767744afbb93dfeb5717775ebb6https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf8352e968503efbbd0ad24173c87d5d9b009adf74bdfdf5df4519be6e4911e39https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc4abacc3987280fcd97a4dad1459c7a811550589357a9c5ec36f6b783a898106- sold FORCE in multiple transactions:https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000b20f0f6a3a212aa6b85106709cd5941457c- later, funds were returned:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4d535b8c68dd7f03e99a3a350d5df7ef0c6a3e0b2edd4f5601637711b960b793",2021-04-04,367000,367000,1,Other,Other,FORCE,0x6807d7f7df53b7739f6438eabd40ab8c262c0aa8

The hype surrounding the Netflix show combined with the increased interest in crypto due to the bull market incentivized big news outlets such as BBC and CNBC to write about the rapid surge in price of the new $SQUID token. Retailers around the world pushed the price from $0,01 to $2,861 in little over a week.

A look at the smart contract revealed that all 3 contracts: SQUID, Marbles, and MasterChef were upgradable. Meaning the contract deployer would change the mechanisms of the project at will.For example a new MasterChef made it possible for the 0x71 EOA to withdraw all tokens from the MasterChef contract at the following transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf7c9d0e5a81999f9e06fe78df7ce41da112d8bd4f2da7b16cfdbbe46c92cb6afThe Squid game project boasted two token. The $Marbels token was required in order to be eligible to sell $SQUID on the open market. $Marbles were not tradable on the market and could only be obtained by participating in the game with an entrance fee of $SQUID 456. Meaning at the all time high price of the SQUID token a withdrawal would have costed at least $1,3 million.The contract deployer also blacklisted all users that did not hold Marble's token to prevent from selling SQUID in this transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5b82e96fccaa9ccc3255b509df51d127aa7ad402624f07683855d0e1c4555041Block Data ReferenceInvolved EOA addresses:https://bscscan.com/address/0x71d934aa2119ca3995f702f075d540f7a6b0f728https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aahttps://bscscan.com/address/0x1f5eabba9c56bca4a7828969b79bc87051125b31https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb650x32 invoked the internal protocol's contract which worked as the interface of the PancakeSwap pair contract to sell SQUID tokens at multiple transactions under the ""0x5c2a8729"" method:https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65Example of ""0x5c2a8729"" transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x98a07fde52914566a72b7eeb2ec1b1af3cb9a0a1d817bb1fb8d6d204993ae96aThe WBNB recipient was EOA, marked as SQUID Token Rug 2, which then deposited stolen funds into Tornado Cash Proxy:https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa2 unverified smart contracts were used to sell SQUID tokens:https://bscscan.com/address/0x95eb532f23a97191324103755332a3dff97d722fhttps://bscscan.com/address/0x5b871670d4f1d81591ecf641588a28f5032c9dcd",2021-11-01,5723268,0,2,Gaming / Metaverse,Rugpull,"SQUID, Marbles","0x87230146E138d3F296a9a77e497A2A83012e9Bc5, 0x9531c509a24ceec710529645fc347341ff9f15ea"

The yUSD balance becomes $16m while the total supply remains $8m. The price of yUSDVault share becomes $2- contract's debt increased to $3b against $2b collateral- using $3b of cryUSD collateral on his balance, borrowed $2b ETH- balance: $2b ETH, $500m yUSD, and $1b in Cream collateral ($3b cryUSD collateral minus $2b ETH debt)- ETH and yUSD were used to pay back the flash loans and utilize the remaining $1b collateral to drain tokens from Cream FinanceWhen retrieving the share price of the yUSD pool, Cream's lending pool uses its pricePerShare interface directly, and this interface is supplemented by the contract's collateral balance and the amount of collateral assets in the strategy pool. To calculate the price of a single share, divide the total number of shares by the number of shares outstanding. As a result, by simply moving the collateral to yUSD, the user can easily increase the price of a single share, allowing the collateral in the Cream loan pool to lend more funds.Block Data ReferenceThe attacker's addresses:https://etherscan.io/address/0x24354d31bc9d90f62fe5f2454709c32049cf866bhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x921760e71fb58dcc8de902ce81453e9e3d7fe253Attacker contract address:https://etherscan.io/address/0x961d2b694d9097f35cfffa363ef98823928a330dThe transaction under the attack:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92",2021-10-27,130000000,0,1,"Borrowing and Lending,Exchange (DEX)",Flash Loan Attack,CREAM,https://etherscan.io/token/0x2ba592F78dB6436527729929AAf6c908497cB200

The pool was valued at 29,851 SUSHI ($300k) after executing the updateMinimumBalance function with the gamed pool value. The attacker then deposited small amounts of SUSHI into the pool, resulting in a massively inflated amount of DEFI5 tokens. Approximately $156m worth of flash swaps in UNI, AAVE, COMP, CRV, MKR, SNX were used for dumping tokens in the pool, minting new DEFI5 tokens, and then burning the DEFI5 for all of the underlying assets.
